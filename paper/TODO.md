# Abstract
  
  * ~~Make clear that functional integration is a contribution. That needs to be added to the abstract. **Keith**: suggest some text.~~
# Introduction
  
  * ~~Last paragraph, "Such risk always exist..." to "Such risk is always present". Or drop, "The goal is to manage or mitigate that risk".~~

# CWP

  * ~~Break " The CWP is a declarative specification that gives precise meaning the purpose as a complex object of work shared by activities in a distributed cognitive system with allowed transformations that move the object from some initial state to a goal state." into two sentences. **Keith will rework.**~~

  * ~~"The object state...": **Keith will give a new paragraph to replace it.**~~

# Conclusion

  * ~~Move the last paragraph in the intro discussing CWP versus LTL to the conclusion. Perhaps just drop because it is already addressed in section LTL. Make clear it is a standard. Add statement in the introduction that the CWP is based on a recognized standard of state machines. Make consistent with LTL.~~

  * ~~Key step towards automation...~~
