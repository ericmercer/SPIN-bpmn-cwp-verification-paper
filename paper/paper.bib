It is critical that clinicians caring for hypoxemic patients recognize two facts: (1) it is common for hypoxemia to exist without dyspnea (“silent hypoxia”); and (2) while patients may initially achieve cardiorespiratory compensation to hypoxemia, this compensation can fail precipitously. The spectrum of variability in human responses to hypoxemia is striking, influenced by differences in respiratory drive (the hypoxic ventilatory response) related to age, medications, coexisting diseases and genetic background. Healthy individuals usually respond to acute hypoxemia with dyspnea, but because of hypoxic suppression of dyspnea (hypoxic ventilatory decline) and hypocarbic suppression of dyspnea, profound hypoxemia can be minimally symptomatic (“silent”), or noticed only during exertion. Cardiovascular compensation for hypoxemia is similarly variable, with the normal responses of tachycardia and increased cardiac output limited by age, genetics, and coexisting disease. Failure to compensate for decreased oxygen transport is signaled by lactic acidosis, bradycardia, and decreased cardiac output. The latter may develop rapidly, and all are indicators of impending tissue injury or death from hypoxemia.}",

WCD is based on theory of distributed cognition and extends established user-centered methods with abstract task modeling, using innovative techniques for work ontology and top-level algorithms to capture the logic of a human-computer interaction paradigm. WCD addresses a long-standing need for more effective methods of function allocation. The illustrating case study succeeded on a large, difficult problem for aircraft scheduling where prior expensive attempts failed. The new system, called Solver, reduces scheduling labor from 9 person-days a week to about 1 person-hour. These results were obtained from the first user test, demonstrating notable effectiveness of WCD. Further, the value of Solver's higher quality schedules is far-reaching. WCD extends HCI methods to fill an important need for technical problem-solving systems.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a new, model-based design method for interactive health information technology (IT) systems. This method extends workflow models with models of conceptual work products. When the health care work being modeled is substantially cognitive, tacit, and complex in nature, graphical workflow models can become too complex to be useful to designers. Conceptual models complement and simplify workflows by providing an explicit specification for the information product they must produce. We illustrate how conceptual work products can be modeled using standard software modeling language, which allows them to provide fundamental requirements for what the workflow must accomplish and the information that a new system should provide. Developers can use these specifications to envision how health IT could enable an effective cognitive strategy as a workflow with precise information requirements. We illustrate the new method with a study conducted in an outpatient multiple sclerosis (MS) clinic. This study shows specifically how the different phases of the method can be carried out, how the method allows for iteration across phases, and how the method generated a health IT design for case management of MS that is efficient and easy to use.}

Recent experimental results on artificial data and theoretical re cults in restricted settings have shown that for selecting a good classifier from a set of classifiers (model selection), ten-fold cross-validation may be better than the more expensive leaveone-out cross-validation. We report on a largescale experiment--over half a million runs of C4.5 and a Naive-Bayes algorithm--to estimate the effects of different parameters on these algrithms on real-world datasets. For crossvalidation we vary the number of folds and whether the folds are stratified or not, for bootstrap, we vary the number of bootstrap samples. Our results indicate that for real-word datasets similar to ours, The best method to use for model selection is ten fold stratified cross validation even if computation power allows using more folds.},

To do so, it is critical to facilitate teamwork and collaboration by improving communication among various participants in the development process and by allowing them to share information and knowledge. In contrast, the engineering design research community has worked on general and abstract theories that are too difficult to apply. To improve this situation, three recommendations for the design community are made. One is to focus on general but concrete problems. Second, research should be directed toward clear goals such as arriving at innovative designs more efficiently. Third, engineering design research should tackle design knowledge issues including ontology, models and model operations.",

Without mathematical rigor, no translation can be trusted to completely represent the LSC specification, while inefficiency renders even provably sound translations useless in verifying the correctness of industrial-strength protocols. Previous work shows that the LSC-to-temporal logic and LSC-to-automata translations can be automated and formalized for the LSC language. In the LSC-to-temporal logic translation, the extraordinary size of the resulting formula limits the scalability of the charts that can be translated and verified. Our work, on the other hand, leverages intuitive temporal logic reductions to generate a formula that is at most quadratic in the size of the chart and demonstrates the benefits of the improved translation on several examples.}

This research work focuses on two specific models for the proposal: a conceptual domain model formalized through a domain ontology, and a system model built using a UML-based notation. The second stems from the first and each provides a Computation Independent View (CIV) with different objectives. Respectively, they allow a common vocabulary for knowledge sharing to be established, and organization functional requirements to be specified, particularly those concerning communication, coordination and collaboration. Furthermore, these models are part of a concrete MDA-based development process of groupware applications that is also introduced.}
