We discuss the safety, legal, and technical factors necessary for implementing such a pathway. This approach has the potential to conserve PPE and protect providers while maintaining safe standards for medical screening exams in the emergency department for low-risk patients in whom COVID-19 is suspected. }",

While this crisis has presented the U.S. healthcare delivery system with unprecedented challenges, the pandemic has catalyzed rapid adoption of telehealth, or the entire spectrum of activities used to deliver care at a distance. Using examples reported by U.S. healthcare organizations, including ours, we describe the role that telehealth has played in transforming healthcare delivery during the 3 phases of the U.S. COVID-19 pandemic: (1) stay-at-home outpatient care, (2) initial COVID-19 hospital surge, and (3) postpandemic recovery. Within each of these 3 phases, we examine how people, process, and technology work together to support a successful telehealth transformation. Whether healthcare enterprises are ready or not, the new reality is that virtual care has arrived.}",

    abstract = "{The Coronavirus infection disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is bringing unprecedented numbers of patients with significant hypoxemia to medical care. It is critical that clinicians caring for hypoxemic patients recognize two facts: (1) it is common for hypoxemia to exist without dyspnea (“silent hypoxia”); and (2) while patients may initially achieve cardiorespiratory compensation to hypoxemia, this compensation can fail precipitously. The spectrum of variability in human responses to hypoxemia is striking, influenced by differences in respiratory drive (the hypoxic ventilatory response) related to age, medications, coexisting diseases and genetic background. Healthy individuals usually respond to acute hypoxemia with dyspnea, but because of hypoxic suppression of dyspnea (hypoxic ventilatory decline) and hypocarbic suppression of dyspnea, profound hypoxemia can be minimally symptomatic (“silent”), or noticed only during exertion. Cardiovascular compensation for hypoxemia is similarly variable, with the normal responses of tachycardia and increased cardiac output limited by age, genetics, and coexisting disease. Failure to compensate for decreased oxygen transport is signaled by lactic acidosis, bradycardia, and decreased cardiac output. The latter may develop rapidly, and all are indicators of impending tissue injury or death from hypoxemia.}",

The programme uses a daily emailed secure link to a survey in which patients submit biometric and symptoms data for monitoring.

abstract = {This paper introduces a new, model-based design method for interactive health information technology (IT) systems. This method extends workflow models with models of conceptual work products. When the health care work being modeled is substantially cognitive, tacit, and complex in nature, graphical workflow models can become too complex to be useful to designers. Conceptual models complement and simplify workflows by providing an explicit specification for the information product they must produce. We illustrate how conceptual work products can be modeled using standard software modeling language, which allows them to provide fundamental requirements for what the workflow must accomplish and the information that a new system should provide. Developers can use these specifications to envision how health IT could enable an effective cognitive strategy as a workflow with precise information requirements. We illustrate the new method with a study conducted in an outpatient multiple sclerosis (MS) clinic. This study shows specifically how the different phases of the method can be carried out, how the method allows for iteration across phases, and how the method generated a health IT design for case management of MS that is efficient and easy to use.}
