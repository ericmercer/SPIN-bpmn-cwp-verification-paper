There is some work related in translating models in the \emph{Business Process Execution Language} (BPEL) to Promela \cite{bpelToPromela}. BPEL semantics are different than BPMN semantics, and the work is limited in scope to modeling web-services. BPMN choreographies have been modeled in Promela and verified with SPIN for deadlock, but choreographies ignore workflows and only model message sequencing \cite{choreography}.

The translation of BPMN to Promela presented here is inspired by existing methods for turning Petri Nets into equivalent Promela models \cite{petrinetToPromela, petrinetInspiration}. These however do not include data as is needed to capture interactions with the CWP. The translation in this paper is also based off of early prototype translations of BPMN to Promela using message channels for synchronization \cite{bpmn2promela}. The translation in this paper uses global variables, and not message channels, for synchronization to mitigate state explosion.
