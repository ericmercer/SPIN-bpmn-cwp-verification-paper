Functional integration of human cognition and machine reasoning is an industry-wide problem where failure risks health or safety.
Differences in human and machine functioning obscure conventional integration. 
We introduce cognitive work problems (CWPs) for higher-order unification that enables rigorous functional integration. 
Graphical modeling standards enable user participation: CWPs as finite state machines and system behavior in BPMN. 
Model checking uses the CWP to prove correctness of the integrated design. 
Its state diagram is translated to linear temporal logic (LTL) and the BPMN into Promela. 
The SPIN model checker then verifies if the Promela implements the LTL correctly. 
The end-to-end method is illustrated on a system that employs AI for remote patient monitoring during COVID-19 home care. 
The CWP specifies the medical problem to solve: \emph{actionable risk awareness}.
SPIN verifies the design can meet its medical purpose. %to enhance patient safety. 
The new method appears general to many critical system domains.
