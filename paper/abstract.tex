Remote health-care that integrates human and machine intelligence for patient monitoring is an active area of research in health IT systems. These systems must take extra precautions to ensure safety since the patient is not in the direct supervision of the medical provider. This paper details the application of model checking to a remote COVID-19 patient monitoring system to prove the system preserves patient safety. The requirements for patient safety are formalized as a cognitive work problem that is translated to Linear Temporal Logic suitable for the SPIN model checker. A cognitive work problem is a computationally independent declarative model stating what a system must accomplish. In this example, the system must take action on risk awareness to enhance patient safety, so the CWP defines the meaning of risk awareness in remote patient monitoring, and it makes clear the decisions that must be made regarding patient safety based on that awareness. The system itself is modeled with the Business Process Modeling Notation to capture the coordinated asynchronous and remote behaviors of the patient at home, the artificial intelligence in the cloud, and the medical providers. These two models with behavior models for patient severity are given to SPIN. SPIN's model checker proves the system implements the decisions related to risk awareness that enhance patient safety as defined in the cognitive work problem. This verification result complements conventional software evaluations and increases the safety and acceptance of such remote health IT systems.
