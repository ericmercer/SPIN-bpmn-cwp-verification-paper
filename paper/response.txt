Thank you for the reviews. Formal verification often requires a high-level of domain expertise for practical application. Venues such as MODELS are critical to helping verification researchers create useable tools and to helping grow understanding of verification and its limitations.

Regarding 1) Functional integration of human and machine reasoning is an industry-wide problem. We address it by proving a system design integrates doctor decisions with AI for remote monitoring. Our purpose in evaluating the system design against the CWP is to verify that it serves its medical purpose. In contrast, information from extracting a CWP out of a design is to discover what that system accomplishes. In this work, Dr. Ann Marie Kimball, MD epidemiologist with specialty in emerging infectious disease, collaborated extensively to create the CWP.  Verifying the workflow against the CWP yielded significant insights about the CWP nonetheless. For example, in an early revision, SPIN found a trace through the workflow where the patient expires while in appropriate home care which is not allowed by the CWP. The error was in the CWP, and not because of the missing transition, but rather because the meaning of appropriate home care was not precise. It omitted information about trending severity that would indicate an elevated risk. The very act of verifying the workflow against the CWP, even assuming the CWP is correct, yields important insights that are easily missed by manual inspection with domain experts.

Regarding 2) SPIN establishes if the Promela and LTL are faithful renditions of their graphical counterparts. The Promela is written in a way that counter-examples can be mapped back to the graphical workflow and CWP.  When SPIN finds a counter-example, it is examined in the context of the graphical models in the same way a failed unit test is debugged in the context of the source code rather than the low level machine code. Additional properties were created that can be understood as unit tests to ensure the Promela matches the graphical counterparts. 

Regarding 3) Scalability is not an issue in this model because of the synchronization points between the swim lanes limiting concurrency, the small number of tasks in the workflow that affect the shared global state, and the relatively few points of non-determinism in the environment. In general, highly concurrent systems, with a lot of non-determinism, that update the shared global state in many places, are less likely to be tractable in SPIN. The size of the LTL formulas also affects scalability but the translation of the CWP to LTL in this manuscript is done in a way to mitigate that affect. 

Regarding determinism on gates in the graphical model: not all gates need be deterministic, and it is to the workflow modeler to make that decision. The verification takes what is given and lets SPIN find violations, which can then be debugged by the workflow modeler to isolate the fault.

Regarding date-race: SPIN finds all data-race regardless if it is a read/write race on global state or message race at an end point.
